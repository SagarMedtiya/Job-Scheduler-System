## 🧩 Architecture Overview

- **Job Controller**: REST API to manage jobs
- **Job Executor**: Responsible for executing jobs from Redis queue
- **Job Failure Handler**: Handles failed jobs and pushes them to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
- **Recurring Job Scheduler**: Manages recurring job scheduling with cron support
- **Redis Queue**: Used for job queuing and retry mechanism
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users (via Redis pub/sub)
- **Jwt Authentication**: provides JWT token generation and validation utilities
